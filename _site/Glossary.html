<h3 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-boxplot"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Box Plot</h3>
<p>A box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary. The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum.</p>
<p>For a description of the quartile see <a href="#sec-quartiles">Section&nbsp;2.1</a>.</p>
<p>A box plot is drawn as a rectangle with the minimum and maximum values at the ends, the first and third quartiles at the middle, and the median at the center. The interquartile range (IQR) is the distance between the first and third quartiles.</p>
<p>Outliers are data points that fall outside the interquartile range. Outliers are usually represented by small circles or asterisks.</p>
<p>Box plots can be used to compare the distributions of data from different groups. For example, you could use a box plot to compare the heights of men and women.</p>
<p>Box plots can also be used to identify outliers. If there are any outliers in a data set, they will be represented by small circles or asterisks.</p>
<p>Box plots are a versatile tool that can be used to visualize the distribution of data. They are considered easy to understand and can be used to compare the distributions of data from different groups.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-histogram"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Histogram</h3>
<p>A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It is a type of bar chart that shows the frequency or number of observations within different numerical ranges, called bins. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of the data, showing the number of observations that fall within each bin. This can be useful for identifying patterns and trends in the data, and for making comparisons between different datasets.</p>
<p>To construct a histogram, the first step is to “bin” (or “bucket”) the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent and are often (but not required to be) of equal size.</p>
<p>Once the bins have been created, the next step is to count the number of observations that fall into each bin. This can be done manually or using a statistical software package. The number of observations in each bin is then plotted as a bar on the histogram. The height of each bar represents the frequency of the data in that bin.</p>
<p>Histograms can be used to visualize a variety of different types of data. They are often used to visualize the distribution of continuous data, such as height, weight, or income. Histograms can also be used to visualize the distribution of discrete data, such as the number of children in a family or the number of cars owned by a household.</p>
<p>Histograms are a valuable tool for data analysis. They can be used to identify patterns and trends in the data, to compare different datasets, and to make inferences about the population from which the data was drawn. Histograms are a simple and easy-to-understand way to visualize data, and they can be used by people with a variety of levels of statistical expertise.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-kernel"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Kernel Density</h3>
<p>Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It is a smooth, continuous function that is constructed by “smoothing” the data points. The smoothing is done by using a kernel function, which is a bell-shaped function that is centered at each data point. The height of the kernel function at a given point is proportional to the amount of data that is near that point.</p>
<p>The kernel density estimate is a powerful tool for visualizing data and for making inferences about the population from which the data was drawn. It can be used to compare different groups of data, to identify outliers, and to estimate the mean, median, and other properties of the population.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how kernel density estimation can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>To visualize the distribution of data.<br>
</li>
<li>To compare different groups of data.<br>
</li>
<li>To identify outliers.<br>
</li>
<li>To estimate the mean, median, and other properties of the population.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kernel density estimation is a versatile and powerful tool that can be used to analyze a wide variety of data. It is a valuable tool for data scientists, statisticians, and anyone who needs to make sense of data.</p>
<p>Here are some of the advantages of using kernel density estimation:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data.<br>
</li>
<li>It is a smooth, continuous function, which makes it easy to visualize and interpret.<br>
</li>
<li>It is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as comparing different groups of data, identifying outliers, and estimating the mean, median, and other properties of the population.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of using kernel density estimation:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.<br>
</li>
<li>The results can be sensitive to the choice of kernel function and bandwidth.<br>
</li>
<li>It can be difficult to interpret the results if the data is not normally distributed.<br>
</li>
<li>Overall, kernel density estimation is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to analyze a wide variety of data.</li>
<li>It is a valuable tool for data scientists, statisticians, and anyone who needs to make sense of data.</li>

<h3 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-loess"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> LOESS curve</h3>
<p>The LOESS curve is a type of smooth curve that is used in <code>ggplot2</code> graphs to fit a line to a set of data points. It is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This makes it a versatile tool for fitting curves to a wide variety of data.</p>
<p>The LOESS curve is calculated using a process called locally weighted regression. This means that the curve is fit to the data points in a local neighborhood around each point. The size of the neighborhood is determined by a parameter called the bandwidth. The bandwidth controls how smooth the curve is. A larger bandwidth will result in a smoother curve, while a smaller bandwidth will result in a more wiggly curve.</p>
<p>The LOESS curve can be used to visualize the relationship between two variables. It can also be used to make predictions about the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.</p>
<p>The LOESS curve is a powerful tool for visualizing and exploring data and can be applied to a wide variety of data.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of using the LOESS curve in graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a non-parametric method, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.</li>
<li>It is a smooth curve that can be used to visualize the relationship between two variables.</li>
<li>It can be used to make predictions about the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.</li>
<li>It is easy to use and can be applied to a wide variety of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the limitations of using the LOESS curve in graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be computationally expensive to fit a LOESS curve to a large dataset.</li>
<li>The LOESS curve can be sensitive to the choice of the bandwidth parameter.</li>
<li>The LOESS curve can be difficult to interpret in some cases.</li>

<h3 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-quartiles"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Quartiles</h3>
<p>Quartiles are a way of dividing a set of data into four equal parts. They are often used to describe the distribution of data and to identify outliers.</p>
<p>The first quartile (Q1) is the middle number between the smallest number (minimum) and the median of the data set. It is also known as the lower or 25th empirical quartile, as 25% of the data is below this point.</p>
<p>The second quartile (Q2) is the median of a data set; thus 50% of the data lies below this point.</p>
<p>The third quartile (Q3) is the middle number between the median and the largest number (maximum) of the data set. It is also known as the upper or 75th empirical quartile, as 75% of the data is below this point.</p>
<p>The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third and first quartiles. It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data.</p>
<p>Quartiles can be used to identify outliers. An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest of the data. Outliers can be identified by comparing them to the quartiles. For example, a data point that is more than 1.5 times the interquartile range above the third quartile or more than 1.5 times the interquartile range below the first quartile is considered to be an outlier.</p>
<p>Quartiles can also be used to compare different data sets. For example, if you have two data sets of test scores, you can compare the quartiles to see how the two data sets are distributed. If the first quartile of the first data set is higher than the first quartile of the second data set, then you know that the lower 25% of the scores in the first data set are higher than the lower 25% of the scores in the second data set.</p>
<p>Quartiles are a useful tool for describing the distribution of data and identifying outliers. They can be used to compare different data sets and to identify trends in data.</p>

<section id="sec-boot" class="level3" data-number="2.2">
<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-boot"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Bootstrap Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>A bootstrap confidence interval is a non-parametric method for estimating the uncertainty around a statistic. It is based on the idea of resampling the original data with replacement, and then re-calculating the statistic of interest on each of the resampled datasets. This process is repeated many times, and the resulting distribution of the statistic is used to construct the confidence interval.</p>
<p>The main advantage of bootstrap confidence intervals is that they do not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This makes them a useful tool for situations where the data is not normally distributed, or where the distribution is unknown.</p>
<p>To construct a bootstrap confidence interval, you will need to specify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The statistic of interest. This could be the mean, median, standard deviation, or any other statistic that you are interested in.</li>
<li>The number of bootstrap replicates. This is the number of times that you will resample the data with replacement. A common choice is 1000 bootstrap replicates.</li>
<li>The confidence level. This is the probability that the confidence interval will contain the true value of the statistic. A common choice is 95%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have specified these parameters, you can use the following steps to construct the bootstrap confidence interval:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Resample the original data with replacement, 1000 times.</li>
<li>Calculate the statistic of interest on each of the resampled datasets.</li>
<li>Order the values of the statistic from the smallest to the largest.</li>
<li>The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the ordered values of the statistic will form the lower and upper bounds of the bootstrap confidence interval.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you are interested in the 95% confidence interval for the mean of a dataset, you would order the values of the mean from the smallest to the largest, and then take the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.</p>
<p>Bootstrap confidence intervals are a powerful tool for estimating the uncertainty around a statistic. They are relatively easy to construct, and they do not require any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This makes them a valuable tool for a wide variety of statistical applications.</p>

It is a number between -1 and 1, with a value of 0 indicating no correlation, a positive value indicating a positive correlation, and a negative value indicating a negative correlation.</p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated by dividing the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. The covariance is a measure of how much the two variables vary together, and the standard deviation is a measure of how much each variable varies from its mean.</p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient can be used to make predictions about one variable from the other. For example, if the correlation between height and weight is 0.7, then we can predict that someone who is 6 feet tall will weigh about 180 pounds.</p>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient is a useful tool for understanding the relationship between two variables. However, it is important to note that it is only a measure of linear correlation. There may be other relationships between two variables that are not linear, and the Pearson correlation coefficient will not be able to detect them.</p>
<p>Here are some of the advantages of using Pearson correlation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is a simple and easy-to-calculate measure of correlation.</p></li>
<li><p>It is widely used and accepted by most statisticians.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be used to make predictions about one variable from the other.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some of the disadvantages of using Pearson correlation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is only a measure of linear correlation.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be sensitive to outliers.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be difficult to interpret if the two variables are not normally distributed.</p></li>

<h3 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-spearmancorr"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Spearman Correlation</h3>
<p>The Spearman correlation is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation. It is used to measure the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. A monotonic relationship is one in which the variables tend to increase or decrease together, but not necessarily in a linear fashion.</p>
<p>The Spearman correlation is calculated by first ranking the data for each variable. The ranks are then used to calculate the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1. A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, a correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation.</p>
<p>The Spearman correlation is a robust measure of correlation, meaning that it is not affected by outliers or non-normality in the data. It is also a relatively simple measure to calculate, making it a popular choice for researchers.</p>
<p>Some examples of when the Spearman correlation could be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>To measure the relationship between height and weight</li>
<li>To measure the relationship between test scores and grades</li>
<li>To measure the relationship between age and income</li>
<li>To measure the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spearman correlation is a versatile tool that can be used to measure the relationship between a wide variety of variables. For measuring the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables, the Spearman correlation is considered a good option.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pvaluespearman"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> p value Spearman correlation</h4>
<p>The p-value in Spearman correlation is a measure of the probability that the observed correlation between two variables is due to chance. It is calculated by comparing the observed correlation to the distribution of correlations that would be expected if the two variables were not correlated.</p>
<p>A p-value of less than 0.05 is generally considered to be statistically significant, meaning that there is less than a 5% chance that the observed correlation is due to chance. A p-value of greater than 0.05 is not statistically significant, meaning that the observed correlation could be due to chance.</p>
<p>For example, there is a correlation between the height and weight of a group of people. You calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient and find that it is r = 0.7. The p-value for this correlation is 0.001. This means that there is less than a 1% chance that the observed correlation is due to chance. Therefore, you can conclude that there is a statistically significant correlation between height and weight in this group of people.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a statistically significant correlation does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship between the two variables. For example, the correlation between height and weight could be due to the fact that both variables are influenced by genetics.</p>

<p>A confidence interval for Spearman correlation (<a href="#sec-spearmanCI">Section&nbsp;3.2.2</a>) is a range of values that is likely to contain the true correlation between two variables. The confidence interval is calculated based on the sample correlation coefficient, the sample size, and the level of confidence desired. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% chance that the true correlation lies within the interval.</p>
<p>The confidence interval for Spearman correlation can be interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower limit of the confidence interval (<em>Lower CI</em>) is the lower bound of the range of values that is likely to contain the true correlation.<br>
</li>
<li>The upper limit of the confidence interval (<em>Upper CI</em>) is the upper bound of the range of values that is likely to contain the true correlation.<br>
</li>
<li>The confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true correlation, but it does not guarantee that the true correlation lies within the interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the confidence interval for Spearman correlation will vary depending on the sample size, the level of confidence desired, and the distribution of the data. For example, a larger sample size will result in a narrower confidence interval. A higher level of confidence will result in a wider confidence interval. And a non-normal distribution of the data may result in a wider confidence interval.</p>
<p>Overall, the confidence interval for Spearman correlation is a useful tool for estimating the true correlation between two variables. The confidence interval can be used to make inferences about the relationship between the variables and to assess the statistical significance of the correlation.</p>

<p>The Wilcoxon rank sum test is a nonparametric test for two populations when samples are independent. It is used to test the null hypothesis that the two populations have the same median, against the alternative hypothesis that they do not. The test is named after Frank Wilcoxon, who published it in 1945.</p>
<p>The Wilcoxon rank sum test works by first ranking all of the data from both samples, regardless of which sample they come from. The ranks are then summed for each sample. The test statistic is the smaller of the two sums.</p>
<p>The p-value for the Wilcoxon rank sum test can be calculated using a variety of methods, including tables, software, or by hand. The p-value is the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.</p>

<p>The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test that can be used to compare the medians of three or more groups. The Dunn’s test is a post-hoc test that can be used to determine which pairs of groups are significantly different after a Kruskal-Wallis test is significant. The Bonferroni correction is a method of adjusting the p-value for multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>To perform a Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc testing with the Dunn’s test and Bonferroni correction, requires data on the dependent variable for each group. The dependent variable should be continuous. The collected data is then ranked from lowest to highest, ignoring group membership. The mean rank for each group will then be calculated. The Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated by dividing the sum of the squared differences between the mean ranks and the overall mean rank by the degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>If the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is significant, you can then perform a Dunn’s test to determine which pairs of groups are significantly different. The Dunn’s test is a pairwise comparison test, which means that it compares each pair of groups to each other. The Dunn’s test statistic is calculated by dividing the difference in the mean ranks for the two groups by the standard error of the difference in the mean ranks.</p>
<p>The Bonferroni correction is a method of adjusting the p-value for multiple comparisons. It is used to control the <em>familywise error rate</em>, which is the probability of making at least one false positive error when conducting multiple comparisons.</p>
<p>The Bonferroni correction is calculated by dividing the original p-value by the number of comparisons being made. For example, if you are conducting 10 comparisons, the Bonferroni corrected p-value would be 0.05/10 = 0.005.</p>
<p>The Bonferroni correction is a conservative method of controlling the <em>familywise error rate</em>.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-hypothesis"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Hypothesis Tests</h3>
<p>A hypothesis test is a statistical procedure that is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two groups or whether there is a significant relationship between two variables. There are two types of hypothesis tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One-tailed tests: These tests are used to determine whether there is a difference between two groups or a relationship between two variables in one direction only. For example, you could use a one-tailed test to determine whether the average height of men is significantly greater than the average height of women.</p></li>
<li><p>Two-tailed tests: These tests are used to determine whether there is a difference between two groups or a relationship between two variables in either direction. For example, you could use a two-tailed test to determine whether the average height of men is significantly different from the average height of women.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The steps involved in a hypothesis test are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.</strong> The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no difference between two groups or that there is no relationship between two variables. The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is a difference between two groups or that there is a relationship between two variables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Select a significance level.</strong> The significance level is the probability of making a type I error, which is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The most common significance level is 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance of making a type I error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Calculate the test statistic.</strong> The test statistic is a number that is used to determine whether the results of the study are statistically significant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Determine the p-value.</strong> The p-value is the probability of getting the results you did, or results that are even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make a decision.</strong> If the p-value is less than the significance level, then you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the two groups or a significant relationship between the two variables. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, then you fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Key points that help understand hypothesis tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypothesis tests are based on probability, so there is always a chance that you will make a type I or type II error.<br>
</li>
<li>The size of the sample can affect the results of a hypothesis test. A larger sample size will generally lead to a more accurate test.<br>
</li>
<li>Hypothesis tests can be used to make inferences about populations, but it is important to remember that the results of a hypothesis test are only based on the sample data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, hypothesis tests are a useful tool for statistical analysis, but they should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pvalue"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> p value</h3>
<p>A p-value is a number between 0 and 1 that tells you the probability of getting the results you did, or results that are even more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true (<a href="#sec-hypothesis">Section&nbsp;4.3</a> explains hypothesis tests). The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no difference between two groups or that there is no relationship between two variables. A p-value of 0.05 or less is generally considered statistically significant, which means that there is less than a 5% chance that the results could have occurred by chance.</p>
<p>For example, it would be interesting to know whether there is a difference in the average height of men and women. You collect data on the heights of 100 men and 100 women and find that the average height of men is 6 feet tall and the average height of women is 5 feet 10 inches tall. The p-value for this test is 0.001, which is less than 0.05. This means that there is less than a 1% chance that the results could have occurred by chance. Therefore, you can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the average height of men and women.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a p-value does not tell you the size of the difference between two groups or the strength of the relationship between two variables. A p-value can be small even if the difference between two groups is small or the relationship between two variables is weak. Therefore, it is important to consider the p-value in conjunction with other factors, such as the size of the difference or the strength of the relationship, when interpreting the results of a statistical test.</p>
<p>Key points that help the interpretation of p-values:</p>
<ul>
<li>P-values are sensitive to the size of the sample. A larger sample size will generally lead to a smaller p-value.</li>
<li>P-values are not affected by the size of the effect. A small p-value can be obtained even if the effect is very small.</li>
<li>P-values are not a measure of the importance of a finding. A finding can be statistically significant but not very important.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, p-values are a useful tool for statistical analysis, but they should be interpreted carefully.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="type-i-and-type-ii-errors"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Type I and Type II errors</h3>
<p>In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can be made: Type I errors and Type II errors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type I error:</strong> A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected, even though it is true. This is also known as a <strong>false positive</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Type II error:</strong> A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected, even though it is false. This is also known as a <strong>false negative</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and the probability of making a Type II error is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. The goal of hypothesis testing is to minimize both <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the significance level of the test. It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The typical value for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is 0.05 or 5%.</li>
<li><strong>Beta:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the power of the test. It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. The higher the power, the less likely it is to make a Type II error.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a trade-off between <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is decreased, then <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> will increase. This means that if we want to be less likely to make a Type I error, then we will be more likely to make a Type II error.</p>
<p>The best way to minimize both <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is to increase the sample size. A larger sample size will give us more data to work with, which will make it less likely to make either a Type I or Type II error.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how Type I and Type II errors can occur in hypothesis testing. Let’s say we are testing the hypothesis that a new drug is effective in treating a certain disease. We collect data from a sample of patients who have been treated with the drug. We find that the drug is effective in treating the disease, and we reject the null hypothesis. However, it is possible that the drug is not actually effective, and that we have made a Type I error. This could happen if the sample size is too small, or if there is some other confounding factor that is affecting the results.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is also possible that the drug is actually effective, but that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This could happen if the sample size is too small, or if the drug is not as effective as we thought it was. This is known as a Type II error.</p>
<p>Type I and Type II errors are an unavoidable part of hypothesis testing. However, by carefully planning our studies and by using large sample sizes, we can minimize the risk of making either type of error.</p>

<p>In statistics, a QQ plot (quantile-quantile plot) is a probability plot, a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. A point (x, y) on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution (y-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (x-coordinate). This defines a parametric curve where the parameter is the index of the quantile interval.</p>
<p>A QQ plot is a plot of the quantiles of two distributions against each other, or a plot based on estimates of the quantiles. The pattern of points in the plot is used to compare the two distributions. The main step in constructing a QQ plot is calculating or estimating the quantiles to be plotted. If one or both of the axes in a QQ plot is based on a theoretical distribution with a continuous cumulative distribution function (CDF), all quantiles are uniquely defined and can be obtained by inverting the CDF.</p>
<p>QQ plots are often used to assess the normality of data. If the data is normally distributed, the points in the QQ plot will fall roughly along a straight line. If the data is not normally distributed, the points in the QQ plot will deviate from a straight line. The direction and amount of deviation can be used to assess the nature of the non-normality.</p>

<p>Pre-treatment of data is a set of techniques used to prepare data for multivariate analysis. The goal of pre-treatment is to improve the quality of the data and make it more suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>There are many different pre-treatment techniques, but some of the most common include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missing value imputation:</strong> This involves filling in missing values in the data. There are many different imputation techniques, such as mean imputation, median imputation, and hot deck imputation.</li>
<li><strong>Outlier detection and removal:</strong> This involves identifying and removing outliers from the data. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They can skew the results of multivariate analysis, so it is important to remove them.</li>
<li><strong>Data normalization:</strong> This involves scaling the data so that all of the variables have a similar range of values. This can help to improve the performance of multivariate analysis algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Feature selection:</strong> This involves selecting a subset of the variables for analysis. This can be helpful if the data set is large or if there are a lot of correlated variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific pre-treatment techniques that are used will depend on the specific data set and the type of multivariate analysis that is being performed. However, in general, pre-treatment is an important step in the multivariate analysis process. It can help to improve the quality of the data and make it more suitable for analysis.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of pre-treating data before multivariate analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can improve the accuracy of the results.</li>
<li>It can make the results more interpretable.</li>
<li>It can help to identify outliers and errors in the data.</li>
<li>It can make the analysis more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are planning to perform multivariate analysis, it is important to take the time to pre-treat your data. This will help to ensure that the results of your analysis are accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>The square root, fourth root, log(x + 1), and presence/absence transformations are all common pre-treatment techniques used in multivariate analysis. These transformations are used to improve the normality of the data, reduce the impact of outliers, and make the data more interpretable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Square root transformation:</strong> The square root transformation is a simple way to reduce the impact of outliers in the data. It is often used in multivariate analysis because it does not change the shape of the distribution too much.</li>
<li><strong>Fourth root transformation:</strong> The fourth root transformation is a more extreme transformation than the square root transformation. It is often used when the data is very skewed or when there are a lot of outliers.</li>
<li><strong>Log(x + 1) transformation:</strong> The log(x + 1) transformation is a useful transformation for data that is not normally distributed. It can help to improve the normality of the data and make it more interpretable.</li>
<li><strong>Presence/absence transformation:</strong> The presence/absence transformation is a simple way to reduce the dimensionality of the data. It is often used when the data is binary or when there are a lot of zeros in the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific pre-treatment technique that is used will depend on the specific data set and the type of multivariate analysis that is being performed. However, in general, the square root, fourth root, log(x + 1), and presence/absence transformations are all useful techniques that can be used to improve the quality of the data before multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>Here are some additional benefits of using these transformations:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can help to improve the accuracy of the results.</li>
<li>They can make the results more interpretable.</li>
<li>They can help to identify outliers and errors in the data.</li>
<li>They can make the analysis more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are planning to perform multivariate analysis, it is important to consider using one or more of these transformations. These transformations can help to improve the quality of the data and make the results of your analysis more accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how these transformations can be used in multivariate analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>In principal component analysis (PCA), the square root transformation is often used to improve the interpretability of the principal components.</li>
<li>In discriminant analysis, the log(x + 1) transformation is often used to improve the separation between the two groups.</li>
<li>In cluster analysis, the presence/absence transformation is often used to improve the compactness of the clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that there is no single “best” pre-treatment technique. The best technique to use will depend on the specific data set and the type of multivariate analysis that is being performed. However, the transformations described above are all good starting points.</p>

<p>Bray-Curtis distance measurement as used in multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>Bray-Curtis distance is a metric used to measure the dissimilarity between two samples. It is based on the relative abundance of species in each sample. The Bray-Curtis distance is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\sum|A_i - B_i|}{\sum(A_i + B_i)}\]</span><br>
where:<br>

<span class="math inline">\(B_i\)</span> is the abundance of species i in sample B<br>
<span class="math inline">\(\sum\)</span> is the sum of all values</p>
<p>The Bray-Curtis distance ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that the two samples are identical and 1 indicating that the two samples are completely different.</p>
<p>Bray-Curtis distance is a popular choice for multivariate analysis because it is relatively easy to calculate and it is sensitive to changes in the relative abundance of species. It is often used in ecology to compare the composition of different communities.</p>
<p>Here are some of the advantages of using Bray-Curtis distance:</p>

<p>Euclidean distance is a measure of the distance between two points in a Euclidean space. In multivariate analysis, it is used to measure the distance between two data points, which are represented by vectors. The Euclidean distance between two data points is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \sqrt{\left( x_1 - x_2 \right)^2 + \left( y_1 - y_2 \right)^2}\]</span><br>
where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the Euclidean distance between the two data points<br>
<span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> are the values of the first data point<br>
<span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> are the values of the second data point</p>
<p>The Euclidean distance is a straight-line distance between two points. It is the most commonly used distance measure in multivariate analysis. It has a number of advantages, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easy to calculate.</li>
<li>It is intuitively appealing.</li>
<li>It is relatively robust to outliers.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Euclidean distance can be sensitive to the scale of the variables. For example, a difference of 1 unit on a variable that is measured in centimeters is much less significant than a difference of 1 unit on a variable that is measured in meters. To address this issue, it is often helpful to standardize the variables before calculating the Euclidean distance.</p>
<p>The Euclidean distance can be used in a variety of multivariate analysis techniques, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster analysis (<a href="#sec-cluster">Section&nbsp;6.5</a>).</li>
<li>Principal component analysis.</li>
<li>Linear discriminant analysis.</li>
<li>k-nearest neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster analysis is a technique for grouping data points together based on their similarity.

<p>Manhattan distance, also known as L1 distance, is a distance metric that measures the distance between two points in a multidimensional space by taking the sum of the absolute differences between their coordinates. It is a more robust to outliers than Euclidean distance and is suitable for both continuous and discrete variables.</p>

<span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> represents the coordinates of the two points.<br>
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> represents the Manhattan distance between the two points.</p>
<p>In multivariate analysis, Manhattan distance can be used for a variety of tasks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Manhattan distance can be used to cluster data points into groups based on their similarity. For example, we could use Manhattan distance to cluster customer data by their spending habits.</li>
<li><strong>Classification:</strong> Manhattan distance can be used to classify data points into two or more classes. For example, we could use Manhattan distance to classify customer data into loyal customers and churned customers.</li>
<li><strong>Anomaly detection:</strong> Manhattan distance can be used to identify outliers in data. For example, we could use Manhattan distance to identify customer data points that have unusually high or low spending habits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of how Manhattan distance can be used in multivariate analysis. Let’s say we have a dataset of customer data that includes the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Spending</li>
</ul>
<p>We could use Manhattan distance to cluster these customers into groups based on their similarity. For example, we might find that younger customers with higher incomes tend to spend more money than older customers with lower incomes. This information could be used to develop marketing campaigns that target specific customer groups.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-cluster"><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> Cluster analysis</h3>
<p>Cluster analysis is a multivariate analysis technique that groups data points together based on their similarity. It is an <strong>unsupervised learning</strong> technique, meaning that it does not require any prior knowledge of the data.</p>
<p>There are many different cluster analysis algorithms, but they all work by finding groups of data points that are close to each other and far from other data points. The most common cluster analysis algorithms are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K-means clustering:</strong> This algorithm groups data points into k clusters, where k is a predetermined number. The algorithm starts by randomly assigning each data point to a cluster. Then, it repeatedly updates the cluster centroids (the average of all data points in a cluster) and the cluster assignments until the centroids no longer change.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical clustering:</strong> This algorithm starts by treating each data point as its own cluster. Then, it repeatedly merges the two most similar clusters until there is only one cluster left. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: <strong>agglomerative</strong> and <strong>divisive</strong>. Agglomerative clustering starts with all data points in their own cluster and merges them together, while divisive clustering starts with all data points in one cluster and divides them into smaller and smaller clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster analysis can be used for a variety of tasks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data exploration:</strong> Cluster analysis can be used to explore data and identify hidden patterns. For example, a marketing team might use cluster analysis to identify different customer segments.</li>
<li><strong>Data reduction:</strong> Cluster analysis can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much of the variation as possible. This can be useful for visualization and for making data easier to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Classification:</strong> Cluster analysis can be used to classify data points into known groups. For example, a medical researcher might use cluster analysis to classify patients into different disease groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze multivariate data. It is important to understand the different cluster analysis algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses in order to use them effectively.</p>
<p>Here are some additional considerations when using cluster analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The number of clusters:</strong> The number of clusters is a critical parameter in cluster analysis. If there are too few clusters, the data will not be well-separated. If there are too many clusters, the clusters will be too small and the results will not be reliable. There is no easy way to determine the optimal number of clusters, and it may be necessary to experiment with different values.</li>
<li><strong>The similarity measure:</strong> The similarity measure is another important parameter in cluster analysis. The most common similarity measure is the Euclidean distance, but other measures, such as the Manhattan distance and the Mahalanobis distance, can also be used. The choice of similarity measure will affect the results of the cluster analysis.</li>
<li><strong>The cluster algorithm:</strong> The cluster algorithm is also an important parameter in cluster analysis. Different algorithms will produce different results, so it is important to experiment with different algorithms to find the one that produces the most meaningful results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze multivariate data. It is important to understand the different cluster analysis algorithms, their strengths and weaknesses, and the factors that can affect the results of cluster analysis in order to use it effectively.</p>

<p>A dendrogram is a tree-like diagram that shows the hierarchical relationships between objects. It is most commonly created as an output from hierarchical clustering, a method of cluster analysis that groups similar objects together.</p>
<p>The dendrogram is a way to visualize the results of the clustering algorithm. The branches of the dendrogram represent the clusters, and the distance between the branches represents the similarity between the clusters. The closer two clusters are on the dendrogram, the more similar they are.</p>
<p>Dendrograms are a powerful tool for visualizing the results of cluster analysis. They can help us to understand the hierarchical relationships between objects, and to identify clusters of similar objects.</p>
<p>The dendrogram can:</p>

<p>Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is a multivariate analysis technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving the distances between objects. NMDS is a non-parametric technique, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data. This makes NMDS a versatile technique that can be used with a wide variety of data sets.</p>
<p>NMDS works by first calculating the distances between all pairs of objects in the data set. These distances can be calculated using any distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance. Once the distances have been calculated, NMDS then finds a configuration of points in a lower-dimensional space (typically two or three dimensions) such that the distances between the points in the lower-dimensional space are as close as possible to the distances in the original data set.</p>
<p>NMDS can be used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualizing the relationships between objects:</strong> NMDS can be used to create a two- or three-dimensional plot of the objects in a data set. This can be helpful for visualizing the relationships between the objects and for identifying clusters of objects.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding the structure of a data set:</strong> NMDS can be used to understand the structure of a data set by examining the distances between the objects in the data set. For example, if the distances between the objects are large, then the objects are likely to be different from each other.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster analysis:</strong> NMDS can be used as a preprocessing step for cluster analysis. By first reducing the dimensionality of the data using NMDS, it can be easier to identify clusters of objects in the data set.</li>

<p>A Shepard plot is a type of graph used in statistics to visualize the results of a multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. MDS is a statistical technique that is used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set by finding a lower-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the distances between the data points.</p>
<p>A Shepard plot shows the relationship between the true distances between the data points in the original high-dimensional space and the distances between the data points in the lower-dimensional representation. If the MDS analysis has been successful, the points in the Shepard plot will be well-correlated, and the line will be a straight line. This indicates that the distances between the data points in the lower-dimensional representation are a good approximation of the true distances between the data points in the original high-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Shepard plots can be used to assess the quality of an MDS analysis. If the points in the Shepard plot are not well-correlated, or if the line is not a straight line, then the MDS analysis may not have been successful. In this case, the analyst may need to try different parameters for the MDS analysis or use a different dimensionality reduction technique.</p>

<p>The Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) test is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between two or more groups of data. ANOSIM is a multivariate test, meaning that it can be used to compare data sets with more than one variable.</p>
<p>ANOSIM works by comparing the distances between observations within and between groups. If the distances between observations within groups are smaller than the distances between observations between groups, then the ANOSIM test will be significant. This indicates that there are real differences between the groups of data.</p>
<p>ANOSIM is a versatile test that can be used in a variety of fields, including ecology, biology, and medicine. It is a powerful tool for identifying and understanding differences between groups of data.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how ANOSIM can be used. Let’s say we have a data set of soil samples from different locations. We want to know if there are any significant differences in the soil composition between the different locations. We can use ANOSIM to compare the distances between soil samples within each location to the distances between soil samples from different locations. If the distances between soil samples within locations are smaller than the distances between soil samples from different locations, then the ANOSIM test will be significant. This indicates that there are real differences in the soil composition between the different locations.</p>

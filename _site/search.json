Once you have tidy data you will spend less time wrangling data from one representation to another, allowing you to spend more time on the analytic questions at hand. Unfortunately, there is a rule of thumb; 80% of time doing data science is spent wrangling data; particularly the effort required in sorting and rearranging the data into the tidy and therefore usable format.\nThere are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy, such as the data shown in Table @ref(tab:table01):"

    "text": "Minimal Data Requirement\nTo undertake meaningful data analysis, it is recommended that data collected from bat activity surveys is wrangled into tidy data that has the following five variables (columns) as a minimum:\n\nDescription\nDateTime\nSpecies\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\nThe rationale for these variables is as follows:\nDescription a column to help identify the observation for example a location, surveyor or survey number.\nDateTime: the date and time of the bat observation to BS ISO 8601:2004 i.e. yyyymmdd hh:mm:ss. The use of BS ISO 8601:2004 prevents confusion over the date format 1 . Reference bat activity to the local time and specifying an iana2 time zone allows for daylight saving times to considered; the iana code for the UK is Europe/London.\nSpecies: bat species names should follow the “binomial nomenclature” from the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)3 - e.g. Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus, etc… A column of local common names can always be added to the tidy data, i.e. in a separate column see Appendix 8. Sound analysis may not be able to distinguish calls to species level; in practice some calls may only be identified to genus or less; Table @ref(tab:table04) gives a practical and consistent guide to naming4.\nLongitude and Latitude: World Geodetic System 19845 (WGS84); as used by Google earth. A digital, numeric, format should be used. Any other spatial reference system can be used (e.g. British National Grid Easting/Northing), as this can be stored as an extra column in the tidy data, the prerequisite is that the reference system can be converted to WGS84; which is the case for most national or state co-ordinate systems. Using a global co-ordinate system such as WSG84 give access to the many open-source application programming interfaces (API) available that assist with data analysis (e.g. assessing sunset and sunrise times or the adjustment to daylight saving)."

Apart from making bat data into a tidy format, there are many other tasks involved in cleaning data: parsing dates and numbers, identifying missing values, correcting character encodings, matching similar but not identical values (such as those created by typos)."

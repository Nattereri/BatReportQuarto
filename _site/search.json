    "text": "Minimal Data Requirement\nTo undertake meaningful data analysis, it is recommended that data collected from bat activity surveys is wrangled into tidy data that has the following five variables (columns) as a minimum:\n\nDescription\nDateTime\nSpecies\nLatitude\nLongitude\n\nThe rationale for these variables is as follows:\nDescription a column to help identify the observation for example a location, surveyor or survey number.\nDateTime: the date and time of the bat observation to BS ISO 8601:2004 i.e. yyyymmdd hh:mm:ss. The use of BS ISO 8601:2004 prevents confusion over the date format 1 . Reference bat activity to the local time and specifying an iana2 time zone allows for daylight saving times to considered; the iana code for the UK is Europe/London.\nSpecies: bat species names should follow the “binomial nomenclature” from the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)3 - e.g. Barbastella barbastellus, Eptesicus serotinus, etc… A column of local common names can always be added to the tidy data, i.e. in a separate column see Appendix 8. Sound analysis may not be able to distinguish calls to species level; in practice some calls may only be identified to genus or less; Table @ref(tab:table04) gives a practical and consistent guide to naming4.\nLongitude and Latitude: World Geodetic System 19845 (WGS84); as used by Google earth. A digital, numeric, format should be used. Any other spatial reference system can be used (e.g. British National Grid Easting/Northing), as this can be stored as an extra column in the tidy data, the prerequisite is that the reference system can be converted to WGS84; which is the case for most national or state co-ordinate systems. Using a global co-ordinate system such as WSG84 give access to the many open-source application programming interfaces (API) available that assist with data analysis (e.g. assessing sunset and sunrise times or the adjustment to daylight saving)."

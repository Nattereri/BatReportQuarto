These web pages compliment the *data science* chapters of the forthcoming BCT Bat Survey Guidelines 4^th^ Edition, and hopefully encourage ecologists to make the most of their bat survey data. They also demonstrate literate programming with Quarto®[^1] and R Markdown[^10] which can vastly improve workflow (*welcome to the world beyond Excel*).

[^1]: Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system: see <https://quarto.org/>
[^10]: R Markdown see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>



![Literate Programming](Images/workflowRed.png){#fig-workflowred}

Literate programming [@knuth84] enables efficient reporting of bat data[^8] from a simple table, such as a count of bats, to the output and interpretation of machine learning; plus everything in-between, see @fig-workflowred; all this can be  accomplished through the RStudio software [@RStudio22]. The code used in these pages is R[^9] [@Rcore22], literate programming also facilitates other coding languages such as Python[^6], and Julia[^7].  Coding languages can be mixed in the same literate programming document; with a chuck of R code doing the data manipulation  and another chunk of Python code performing the machine learning.  Coding languages applied to data science are developing rapidly in terms of their ability, speed of execution, and user friendliness[^5]; literate programming provides the framework for ecologists to keep their data science skills moving forward.

[^5]:  Julia has a language syntax similar to Python, runs fast, has a statistical library like R and linear programming skills similar to MATLAB.

To help ecologists get started, all the code making the graphs and analysis is freely available to copy and use; just click on  _Show the code_, copy to the clipboard [^2], paste into the R environment and run (to get going in R see @sec-installr). 

[^2]: Clip board icon is in the top right hand corner of the code window.

A _Show the code_ is given below, the code produces @fig-example.  The code copied to the clipboard is designed to run as a standalone _chunk_; with all the R libraries, data and code.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: "Example Graph: Monthly Bat Activity from the statics data set in the iBats Package"
#| warning: false
#| fig.height: 7

### Libraries Used
library(tidyverse) # Data Science packages - see https://www.tidyverse.org/
library(treemapify) # extension to ggplot for plotting treemaps -
# see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treemapify/vignettes/introduction-to-treemapify.html
library(ggthemes) # for colour pallet "Tableau 10"

# Install devtools if not installed
# devtools is used to install the iBats package from GitHub
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# If iBats not installed load from Github
if (!require(iBats)) {
  devtools::install_github("Nattereri/iBats")
}
library(iBats)
###

# Add data and time information to the iBats statics bat survey data set using the iBats::date_time_info
statics_plus <- iBats::date_time_info(statics)

graph_data <- statics_plus %>%
  group_by(Species, Month) %>%
  tally()

ggplot(graph_data, aes(area = n, fill = Month, label = Species, subgroup = Month)) +
  scale_fill_tableau(palette = "Tableau 10") + #
  geom_treemap(colour = "white", size = 2, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = "black", size = 5, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(place = "centre", grow = T, alpha = 0.9, colour = "grey20", min.size = 0) +
  geom_treemap_text(colour = "grey90", place = "topleft", fontface = "italic", reflow = T, min.size = 0, alpha = 0.9) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # No legend
```


## Install R, RStudio and Packages {#sec-installr}

1.  Download and install the latest version of R <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>. Download the version for your operating system; R can be downloaded for Windows, Mac & Linux.\
2.  It is recommended R is used through the *RStudio* IDE. Download and install the latest version of RStudio from their web page <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop>. Download the *free* desktop version.

### Install the *iBats* Package from GitHub

The `iBats` package contains example data and functions that help with the *Data Science* of bat survey results. To install this package use the code below in the console (see Figure ); *one line at a time*. The package is installed from GitHub.


```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| eval: false

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Nattereri/iBats")


```

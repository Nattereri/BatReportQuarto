These web pages complement the *data science* chapters of the forthcoming BCT Bat Survey Guidelines 4^th^ Edition, and hopefully encourage ecologists to make the most of their bat survey data. They also demonstrate literate programming with Quarto®[^1] and R Markdown[^13] which can vastly improve workflow (*welcome to the world beyond Excel*).

[^1]: Quarto® is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system: see <https://quarto.org/>
[^13]: R Markdown see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>



![Literate Programming](Images/workflowRed.png){#fig-workflowred}

Literate programming [@knuth_literate_1984], outlined in @fig-workflowred, enables efficient reporting of bat data[^8] from a simple table, such as a count of bats, to the output and interpretation of machine learning; plus everything in-between; all accomplished through R[^9] [@R-base] and RStudio [@RStudio22]. 

[^5]:  Julia has a language syntax similar to Python, runs fast, has a statistical library like R and linear programming skills similar to MATLAB.

[^8]:  as exported from sound analysis software
[^9]:  Windows <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> Mac Intel & ARM <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>

To help get ecologists started, all the code making the graphs and analysis in these web pages is free to copy and use;  just click on  _Show the code_, copy to the clipboard [^2], paste into the R environment and run. If new to R and RStudio see @sec-installr. 

[^2]: Clip board icon is in the top right hand corner of the code window.

A _Show the code_ is given below, the code produces @fig-example.  The code copied to the clipboard is designed to run as a standalone _chunk_ (or _R script_)[^11]; the code loads the required R libraries and data.

[^11]: Many R script's are required in applying literate programming to bat data science; these are best organised through Quarto or R Markdown documents where the R scripts form code chunks.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: "Example Graph: Monthly Bat Activity from the statics data set in the iBats Package"
#| warning: false
#| fig.height: 7

### Libraries Used
library(tidyverse) # Data Science packages - see https://www.tidyverse.org/
library(treemapify) # extension to ggplot for plotting treemaps -
# see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treemapify/vignettes/introduction-to-treemapify.html
library(ggthemes) # for colour pallet "Tableau 10"

# Install devtools if not installed
# devtools is used to install the iBats package from GitHub
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# If iBats not installed load from Github
if (!require(iBats)) {
  devtools::install_github("Nattereri/iBats")
}
library(iBats)
###

# Add data and time information to the iBats statics bat survey data set using the iBats::date_time_info
statics_plus <- iBats::date_time_info(statics)

graph_data <- statics_plus %>%
  group_by(Species, Month) %>%
  tally()

ggplot(graph_data, aes(area = n, fill = Month, label = Species, subgroup = Month)) +
  scale_fill_tableau(palette = "Tableau 10") + #
  geom_treemap(colour = "white", size = 2, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = "black", size = 5, alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(place = "centre", grow = T, alpha = 0.9, colour = "grey20", min.size = 0) +
  geom_treemap_text(colour = "grey90", place = "topleft", fontface = "italic", reflow = T, min.size = 0, alpha = 0.9) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") # No legend
```

Literate programming facilitates the use of other coding languages such as Python[^6], and Julia[^7], these languages can be mixed in the same literate programming document; with a chuck of R code doing the data manipulation  and another chunk of Python code performing the machine learning.  Coding languages applied to data science are developing rapidly in terms of their ability, speed of execution, and user friendliness[^5]; literate programming provides the framework for ecologists to keep their data science skills moving forward.

## Install R, RStudio and Packages {#sec-installr}

1.  Download and install the latest version of R <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>. Download the version for your operating system; R can be downloaded for Windows, Mac & Linux.\
2.  It is recommended R is used through the *RStudio* IDE. Download and install the latest version of RStudio from their web page <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop>. Download the *free* desktop version.

### Install the *iBats* Package from GitHub

The `iBats` package contains example data and functions that help with the *Data Science* of bat survey results. To install this package use the code below in the RStudio _Console_; one line at a time. The package is installed from GitHub.


```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| eval: false

install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("Nattereri/iBats")


```

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes 70-90% of any modern software solution[^11]. R and RStudio are 
open source software that have made data science more open, intuitive, accessible, and collaborative. As a Public Good[^10] the value of FOSS is yet to be fully recognised. FOSS is provided by a large community, without whom these web pages would not be written; some of this community are acknowledged as individuals in the references section of the [Resources](https://bat-survey-reporting.netlify.app/resources.html) page.

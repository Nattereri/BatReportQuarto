Many other columns would be added to a tidy dataset so it becomes more useful for analysis; some of these are described below.

## The _Night_ 

Bats are active through the night; the date of the night is the date at sunset and lasts to sunrise the morning of the following day. The _Night_ is a variable column that is added to the _tidy_ data; it is useful convention that helps avoid the confusion of having contiguous bat activity over two dates.

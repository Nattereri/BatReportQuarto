**Reporting Bat Survey Data** compliments the *data science* chapters of the forthcoming BCT Bat Survey Guidelines 4^th^ Edition. Unlike the guidelines it has the R code making the analysis; which can be copied and used.

These web pages were written by Steve Markham, Director and Data Scientist at *Marquis & Lord Ltd.* Over my 39 year career I have developed and applied software applications to water management and more recently, the last 15 years, applied *data science* to a wide range of projects using the R software environment. I have held a Natural England Roost Visitors Licence since 1997, undertaking numerous commercial bat projects and voluntary bat work, including being a Trustee of the Bat Conservation Trust from 2012 to 2021. I have been on the editorial board of all the editions of the Bat Survey Guidelines[^1], encouraging ecologists to make the most of their bat survey data; these web pages hopefully make it easier to do this, and more rewarding - its good for bats!

This web site also introduces the `iBats` package[^2]. `iBats` is a package with a range of functions that hopefully enhances and smooths the *data science* of bat data collected from bat detectors post sound identification.

[^2]: the `iBats` package is held on GitHub: <https://github.com/Nattereri/iBats>

<!-- The `iBats` name is borrowed from Prof Kate Jones and follows in the citizen science spirit of the original __iBats__. -->

Finally a special thanks to the bat workers who have put up with my incessant data talk, especially: Amanda, Anna, Kevin, Liat, Phil, Richard and, Suzy.

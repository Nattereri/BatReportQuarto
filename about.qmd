__Reporting Bat Survey Data__ compliments the _data science_ chapters of the forthcoming BCT Bat Survey Guidelines 4^th^ Edition. Unlike the guidelines it has the R code making the analysis; which can be copied and used.

These web pages were written by Steve Markham, Director and Data Scientist at _Marquis & Lord Ltd._ Over my 39 year career I have developed and applied software applications to water management and more recently, the last 15 years, applied _data science_ to a wide range of projects using the R software environment. Since 1997 I have held a Natural England Roost Visitors Licence, undertaking numerous commercial bat projects and voluntary bat work, including being a Trustee of the Bat Conservation Trust from 2012 to 2021.  I have been on the editorial board of all the editions of the Bat Survey Guidelines[^1], encouraging ecologists to make the most of their bat survey data; these web pages hopefully make it easier to do this, and more rewarding - its good for bats! 

This web site also introduces the `iBats` package[^2]. `iBats` is a package with a range of functions that hopefully enhances and smooths the _data science_ of bat data collected from bat detectors post sound identification.  

<!-- The `iBats` name is borrowed from Prof Kate Jones and follows in the citizen science spirit of the original __iBats__. -->

Finally a special thanks to the bat workers that have put with my incessant data talk, especially: Amanda, Anna, Kevin, Liat, Phil, Richard and, Suzy.

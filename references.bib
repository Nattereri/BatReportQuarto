  abstract      = {
    \&amp;lt;p\&amp;gt;Despite the large body of research on missing value
    distributions and imputation, there is comparatively little literature with a
    focus on how to make it easy to handle, explore, and impute missing values in
    data. This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy
    data principles, with the goal of integrating missing value handling as a key
    part of data analysis workflows. We define a new data structure, and a suite
    of new operations. Together, these provide a connected framework for
    handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods are available
    in the R package naniar.\&amp;lt;/p\&amp;gt;

  abstract = {Summary 1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
